# Mind Map Governance

This document defines the governance process for the OSPO Mind Map.

## Changes in Maintainership

On successful merge of a significant pull request any current maintainer can reach to the author behind the pull request and ask them if they are willing to become a mainatiner. They can send a PR to [settings.yml file](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/.github/settings.yml#L18) and request the existing maintainers to vote them in.

If a maintainer feels she/he/they can not fulfill the "Expectations from Maintainers", they are free to step down.

## Feature request voting process

Feature requests are proposed by the community and selected by **OSPOlogy Maintainers**. Current mainainers are listed in [settings.yml file](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/.github/settings.yml#L18).

To become a new maintainer, contirbutors shall be responsible to:

* Actively participate in PR reviews and respond in a timely fahsion
* Contribute to OSPO Mind Map by improving project documentation, mind map content, visibility or accessibility.

In case of conflict resolution, the [TODO Steering Committee](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/master/CHARTER.adoc) will have the final oversight of the feature requests.

All voting is done via a simple majority of maintainers.

## Expectations from Maintainers

Every one carries water and helps out!

Every maintainer is listed in the [settings.yml file](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/.github/settings.yml#L18) 

Making a community work requires input and effort from everyone. Maintainers should actively participate in PR reviews and respond in a timely fahsion.
